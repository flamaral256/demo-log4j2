# StatusLogger is a standalone, self-sufficient Logger implementation to record events that occur in the logging
# system (i.e., Log4j) itself. It is the logging system used by Log4j for reporting the status of its internals.
# WARNING: You are strongly advised to configure the status logger only using -D system properties or env variables,
# because if you set properties in this file, you CANNOT override them using -D or env variables!

# If not false, sets the level of the status logger to TRACE overriding any other system property or env variable
# DO NOT SET IT HERE! IF you set in this file, you CANNOT override using -Dlog4j2.debug=true or LOG4J_DEBUG=true
# log4j2.debug=false (default value)

# This property replaces the old status level in the log4j2.properties file. It is useful for development troubleshooting only
# I set it here for convenience, because you can still override it with -Dlog4j2.debug=true or LOG4J_DEBUG=true if necessary
# Specifies the level of the status logger (default error). If log4j2.debug is enabled, the level will be forced to TRACE
