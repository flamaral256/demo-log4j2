# StatusLogger is a standalone, self-sufficient Logger implementation to record events that occur in the logging
# system (i.e., Log4j) itself. It is the logging system used by Log4j for reporting status of its internals.
# WARNING: You are strongly advised to configure the status logger only using -D system properties!

# If not false (default value), sets the level of the status logger to TRACE overriding any other system property
log4j2.debug=false
# Specifies the level of the status logger (default error). Can be overridden by log4j2.debug
log4j2.statusLoggerLevel=error
